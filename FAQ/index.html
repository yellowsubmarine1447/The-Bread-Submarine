    <h1> FAQ </h1>
    <br>
    <h2> Why is buying bread so expensive and why do I gain little by selling? </h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      With buying bread, the lowest price I can go is $8, notice this is because of the trade with 6 wheat and $7. There would be no purpose for that trade if the price of this trade went any lower, and the two exist to separate those with resources from those without. As for why you gain little from selling, the original amount was actually $5, but then with some testing, I found out that would break the business. So $4 is the maximum. Besides, these two trades aren't meant to do much except balance surplus and deficiency, they are actively discouraged and both won't be active simultaneously at any point in time.

    <h2> Why did you make a website? </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Because I'm an <b>epic</b> programmer
    </p>
    <h2> Are these the only trades I can make </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      You may organise other trades with me. Obviously I have to accept it first, so do consider that
    </p>
    <h2> Rep? </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Kind of like a flybuys rewards card: you are rewarded for more purchases you make to the businesses More purchases, more points, more stuff.
